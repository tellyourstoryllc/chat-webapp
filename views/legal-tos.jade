  | <p class="p3"><span class="s3">Arbitration Process</span></p>
  | <p class="p3">A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="s1"> HYPERLINK "http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175" http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</span> and a separate form for California residents at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="s1"> HYPERLINK "http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822" \t "_blank" http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822</span>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
  | <p class="p4"><br></p>
  | <p class="p3"><span class="s3">Arbitration Location and Procedure</span></p>
  | <p class="p3">Unless you and Perceptual otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Perceptual submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
  | <p class="p4"><br></p>
  | <p class="p3"><span class="s3">Arbitrator’s Decision</span></p>
  | <p class="p3">The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Perceptual will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
  | <p class="p4"><br></p>
  | <p class="p3"><span class="s3">Fees</span></p>
  | <p class="p3">Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Perceptual will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
